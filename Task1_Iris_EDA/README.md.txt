# Task 1 – Iris Dataset Exploration

## Objective
To explore and visualize the Iris dataset in order to understand feature distributions, relationships, and potential outliers using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Dataset Used
- Name: Iris Dataset
- Source: Loaded using seaborn
- Samples: 150
- Features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Target Variable: Species

## Key Results & Findings

- Dataset contains no missing values.
- Petal length and petal width clearly separate species.
- Sepal features show overlapping distributions.
- Some mild outliers were identified through box plots.
- Petal measurements are more discriminative than sepal measurements.
